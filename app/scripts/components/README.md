This directory contains React.js components.

The entire UI of the app is rendered with React components.

These components are developed in React's JSX language.  The JSX is compiled into regular javascript in development, before being deployed to production.

This compilation happens via the gulp.js build system.  The entire build process is defined in gulpfile.js.
